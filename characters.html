            <h5 class="card-title">Pyro</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Pyro is a laid-back, somewhat grumpy man made entirely of fire. Born as a human in Colombia, he now exists in a state of perpetual flame. Despite his intimidating appearance, he is fiercely loyal to his friends and values their safety above all else. Though he can be impulsive and hot-headed when the situation calls for it, he often prefers to take a more relaxed, nonchalant approach to life. His fiery nature, however, only manifests when his emotions are heightened or when he chooses to unleash it. Deep down, Pyro struggles with his past and his transformation, but his sense of humor and carefree attitude help him cope. His biggest challenge is finding balance between the burning fury inside him and the calm, composed person he strives to be.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Alex</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Alex is a clever and resourceful human who uses his wit and quick thinking to navigate through tough situations. Though he’s about 17 years old, Alex often feels older because of the responsibility he’s taken on to keep his friends safe. He’s a bit lazy but knows how to get things done without unnecessary effort, always opting for the smart route rather than the hard one. Alex has a sharp mind and is quick to solve problems, often coming up with creative solutions in moments of crisis. Though he often takes on the role of mediator between Pyro and Rob, his true strength lies in his ability to adapt and stay calm when the world around him feels like it’s falling apart. Alex is the support to the trio, helping them act normal in situations that need it.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Rob</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Rob is a Scottish robot with extendable limbs, OCD, and anxiety. He was once human, but his transformation into a machine has made him something else entirely. Though he struggles with his newfound robotic nature, Rob’s personality remains very much intact. He’s highly intelligent and meticulous, though his OCD often causes him to fixate on details that others might overlook. His anxiety manifests in moments of stress, making him prone to overthinking and second-guessing himself, but his loyalty and protective instincts are unmatched. Rob’s relationship with Pyro and Alex is one of deep trust, and he would do anything to protect them, even if it means stepping outside his comfort zone.</p>

      <!-- Dr. Kreel -->

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Dr. Kreel</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Dr. Kreel is a mad scientist with a dark obsession for experimentation. He created Pyro and Rob, trapping them in their new forms and manipulating them as his test subjects. Though he acts as a paternal figure, his care is twisted, and his version of "love" is steeped in control and power. He sees Pyro and Rob not as friends or creations but as tools to further his scientific pursuits. His lack of morality and complete disregard for the lives of others make him a dangerous figure, one who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. Despite his role as the antagonist, Dr. Kreel’s intelligence and manipulative nature make him a formidable adversary, and he remains a constant threat to Pyro, Rob, and even Alex. </p>
            <p>(Please note that I have not finalized Dr. Kreel's design yet, so I am holding off showing any prototype. Feel free to create drawings and send them to me, I might use one of your drawings as the real Dr. Kreel, I will credit you as the designer as well! All you have to do is contact me on the contact page, and mention you want to show me your drawing of Dr. Kreel, and feel free to be creative, I do not see Dr. Kreel being a stereotype of a mad scientist).</p>
