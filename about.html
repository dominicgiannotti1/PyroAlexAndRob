  <img src="images/me.jpeg" alt="Dominic Giannotti" class="rounded-circle me-3" style="width: 170px; height: 170px; object-fit: cover; float: left;">
  My name is <strong>Dominic Giannotti</strong>. I was born on <strong>June 15, 2005</strong>. I’m currently studying <strong>Computer Science</strong> with a focus on <strong>Web Development</strong> at <em>Ozarks Technical Community College</em>. I'm also an <strong>Eagle Scout</strong>.
</p>

      <p>Creating websites is something I genuinely enjoy because it allows me to express my creativity and problem-solving skills at the same time. But beyond that, my biggest dream is to bring my animated series, <strong>Pyro, Alex, and Rob</strong>, to life as a full-time creative career. I hope one day this series becomes something stable and successful — something I can build my future on.</p>

      <h3 class="mb-3">In the Beginning</h3>
      <p>I've always been a massive fan of <strong>Nintendo</strong>. I collect their consoles, handhelds, and games, and growing up, I would binge-watch anything Mario-related. One YouTube channel in particular, <strong>Super Mario Logan</strong>, had a huge impact on me. It featured plush characters from the Mario franchise, and even though the content had some inappropriate language (which I didn’t realize at the time), I thought it was hilarious.</p>
      <p>I would grab my iPad and my own Nintendo plushes to make my own five-minute "episodes" inspired by their content. Eventually, at age 13, I learned how to actually upload videos to YouTube. This is where my passion for making videos and stories really took off. I even had some friends join me at the time for new voices. I ran that channel for a few years before deciding to retire it, but the spark it gave me never went away. And neither did my love of Nintendo and their history. Still a huge fan to this day.</p>
      <p>If you’re curious about Super Mario Logan, you can find re-uploads of their old content here:<br>

      <h3 class="mb-3">The Origin of Pyro, Alex, and Rob</h3>
      <p><strong>Pyro, Alex, and Rob</strong> started as silly stick figure comics in my 7th grade English class, drawn with an old friend on loose paper. Sadly, the original drawings are long gone, but I still remember them clearly. The very first comic was about Rob crying over the ending of <em>Marvel's Endgame</em>, Alex spoiling it mid-conversation, and Pyro freaking out because he was about to watch it.</p>
      <p>Back then, Pyro was actually a nickname — his real name was <em>Flamesmen</em>, and in the comic's title panel, he crossed out “Flamesmen” and wrote “Pyro” over it in marker. The name stuck from then on.</p>
      <p>After that class, the characters faded into the background of my life for a few years. I got a drawing tablet for Christmas one year, hoping to revive the idea — only to realize it required a computer I didn’t have yet. I even experimented with turning the characters into <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com" target="_blank">SCPs</a> for fun — Pyro and Rob as SCP subjects, Alex as a Class C Guard — but I scrapped that quickly. I wanted something original.</p>

    <section class="mb-5">
      <h3 class="mb-3">A Dream Reignited</h3>
      <p>At 19, the dream returned stronger than ever. I added a new character — <strong>Dr. Kreel</strong> — and began writing a deeper story about who Pyro and Rob are, how they came to be, and how Alex fits into their world. My first animation was created with <em>Flipnote Studio 3D</em> on my 3DS. It was basic, and the characters lacked detail, but it was a real start. Now, with a proper computer and drawing tablet, I’m working hard to bring these characters to life with much more depth and emotion.</p>
      <p>I’m a one-man editing team, but I’ve had amazing help from <strong>William (Earl) Smith</strong>, who voices <strong>Rob</strong> and <strong>Dr. Kreel</strong> and also proofreads my scripts to catch continuity errors. I’ve already completed many scripts and even included subtle foreshadowing in some — so theory lovers, pay attention!</p>
      <p>While most episodes are story-driven, there will be more relaxed, world-building ones too. But don’t let those fool you — sometimes the lighthearted episodes contain major details hidden in plain sight. Keep an eye out.</p>
